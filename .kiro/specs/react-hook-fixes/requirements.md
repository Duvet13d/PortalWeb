# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing critical React hook errors that prevent it from running properly. The errors indicate that hooks are being called outside of function components or outside the proper React context. Specifically, the `useContext`, `useLocation`, and `useNavigate` hooks from React Router are failing because they're being called when the React dispatcher is null or outside the Router context. This needs to be fixed to restore application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React hooks to be called properly within the component lifecycle, so that the application can render without throwing hook-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all React hooks SHALL be called only inside function components
2. WHEN React Router hooks are used THEN they SHALL only be called within components that are children of the Router component
3. WHEN the ScrollToTop component renders THEN it SHALL not cause hook errors
4. WHEN the AnimatedRoutes component renders THEN it SHALL not cause hook errors
5. WHEN the useKeyboardShortcuts hook is called THEN it SHALL not cause dispatcher null errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load and display properly, so that I can use all the features without encountering error screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL render the main interface without React errors
2. WHEN navigating between routes THEN the scroll-to-top functionality SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN they SHALL function without causing hook errors
4. WHEN the error boundary catches errors THEN it SHALL display appropriate fallback UI instead of crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper component structure and hook usage, so that the application follows React best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use Router hooks THEN they SHALL be properly nested within the Router provider
2. WHEN custom hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the Rules of Hooks
3. WHEN the component tree is structured THEN Router-dependent components SHALL be children of the Router
4. WHEN hooks are called conditionally THEN they SHALL maintain consistent call order across renders
